## Discovery

During our development process, we conducted interviews with four dance academies to understand their needs and pain points. Through these interviews, we gained valuable insights into the challenges faced by dance academies in managing their operations effectively. The key pain points identified are as follows:

### Pain Points

1. **Lack of Management System**: Many dance academies currently do not have a system in place to effectively manage their operations. This makes it challenging to efficiently assign dancers to sessions, especially with a variety of plans and schedules to consider.

2. **Difficulty in Attendance Management**: There is a high level of irregularity in presentism, making it difficult for dance academies to track attendance and ensure accurate assistance records.

3. **Payment Management**: Dance academies struggle to manage payments effectively. They need a solution that streamlines payment processes and provides transparency for both academy owners and dancers.

4. **Session Visibility**: Dance academies want to showcase available sessions to dancers and staff, allowing them to easily see what is available and plan accordingly.

5. **Calendar Management**: The ability to view and manage calendars is crucial for both staff and dancers. Dance academies need a solution that offers calendar functionality for scheduling and coordination purposes.

6. **Flexible Plans**: Offering flexibility in plans is essential for dance academies. They need the ability to set different plans, such as monthly subscriptions or packages for a specific number of classes within a defined period.
